# Sliding Puzzle Game in JavaScript

This is a 16 piece puzzle game implemented in HTML/CSS/JavaScript with tests written in QUnit.

The game provides a 4 x 4 grid.  The goal is to numerically order the pieces from 1 to 15, left to right, top to bottom.

```
1   2   3   4
5   6   7   8
9   10  11  12
13  14  15  x
```

Moves are made by shifting the blank space (`x`), which swaps it with an adjacent piece.
